### <h3 id="Cpg">1.5 Compound Governance<h3>

Compound protocol is a decentralized protocol which establishes money markets with
algorithmically set interest rates based on supply and demand, allowing users to frictionlessly
exchange the time value of Ethereum assets.

Compound Governance refers to the decentralized governance system employed by Compound Finance, a prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Compound Finance is built on the Ethereum blockchain and provides lending and borrowing services for various cryptocurrencies.

The governance mechanism allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process regarding the protocol's development, changes, and upgrades. The native token of Compound, COMP, plays a central role in this governance system.

#### Key aspects of Compound Governance include:

1. COMP Token: COMP is the governance token of the Compound protocol. Holders of COMP can propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol. The number of COMP tokens held by an individual determines their voting power.

2. Proposal Creation: Any COMP holder can create a proposal to suggest changes to the protocol. Proposals can range from protocol parameter adjustments to adding new features.

3. Voting: COMP holders can vote "for," "against," or "abstain" on proposed changes. The voting power is directly proportional to the number of COMP tokens held by the voter.

4. Quorum and Approval: Proposals must meet a minimum quorum (a minimum number of votes) to be considered valid. Additionally, they require a certain percentage of "for" votes to be approved.

5. Execution of Proposals: Once a proposal is approved, it can be executed, resulting in the implementation of the proposed changes.

Compound Governance empowers the community to collectively govern the protocol, ensuring a decentralized and inclusive decision-making process for the platform's evolution and improvements.

### <h3 id="Gbd">1.6 GovernorBravoDelegate<h3>

The GovernorBravoDelegate contract is an implementation of the GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2 and GovernorBravoEvents contracts, which are part of the governance system of the Compound protocol. The purpose of this contract is to allow token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, such as adding new assets to the protocol or changing the interest rates of existing assets. The contract defines various constants and functions that set the parameters for the governance process, such as the minimum and maximum voting periods, the quorum votes required for a proposal to succeed, and the maximum number of actions that can be included in a proposal. Overall, the GovernorBravoDelegate contract plays a critical role in the decentralized governance of the Compound protocol.

  - Call the vote function to vote on a proposal.

### <h3 id="overview"> 1.9 System Overview <h3>

- #### GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2.sol

  This contract is designed for decentralized governance using a voting system, allowing users to propose, vote on, and execute actions. It also includes functionality for whitelisting and administration. It implements safety checks and ensures proper governance mechanisms are in place to manage proposals and voting.

- #### GovernorBravoEvents.sol

  This contract defines events that are emitted during various actions in the governance system, such as proposal creation, voting, proposal cancellation, and more.

- #### GovernorBravoDelegateStorage.sol

  This contract defines the storage variables used in the governance system, including the administrator, pending administrator, and the active implementation (logic) of the Governor.

- #### GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1:

  This contract extends GovernorBravoDelegatorStorage and adds more storage variables related to the governance parameters and proposals. It includes variables like voting delay, voting period, proposal threshold, proposal count, and more.

- #### GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2:

  This contract extends GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1 and adds additional storage variables related to whitelist management. It includes whitelist account expiration timestamps and the whitelist guardian's address.

  - #### TimelockInterface

  This interface defines the functions that can be called on the Timelock contract. The delay function returns the delay period specified in the Timelock contract. The GRACE_PERIOD function returns the grace period specified in the Timelock contract. The acceptAdmin function is used to accept the admin role for the Timelock contract. The queuedTransactions function is used to check whether a transaction with the specified hash has been queued in the Timelock contract. The queueTransaction function is used to add a transaction to the queue in the Timelock contract. The cancelTransaction function is used to cancel a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract. The executeTransaction function is used to execute a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract.

- #### CompInterface:

  This interface defines the functions that can be called on the COMP token contract. The getPriorVotes function is used to get the number of votes that an account had at a specific block number. This function is used in the governance system of the Compound protocol to determine the voting power of token holders.

- #### GovernorAlpha:

  This interface defines the function that can be called on the GovernorAlpha contract. The proposalCount function returns the total number of proposals (state variable) that have been created in the governance system of the Compound protocol. This function is used to keep track of the number of proposals.

## <h2 id="review"> 2.0 CONTRACT REVIEW <h2>

The following functions are part of the compound governance contract and are all carefully and thoroghly intertwined for optimum performance.

### 2.1 initialize():

This function initializes the contract. It is a public function with five input parameters: timelock, comp address, votingPeriod, votingDelay, and proposalThreshold. This function is used to initialize the contract during the delegator constructor.

### 2.2 propose():

This function creates a new proposal. It is a public function with three input parameters: targers (an array of target addresses), values (an array of Eth values), signatures (an array of function signatures), calldatas (array) and description of the proposal This function is used to create a new proposal.
