### <h3 id="Cpg">1.5 Compound Governance<h3>

Compound protocol is a decentralized protocol which establishes money markets with
algorithmically set interest rates based on supply and demand, allowing users to frictionlessly
exchange the time value of Ethereum assets.

Compound Governance refers to the decentralized governance system employed by Compound Finance, a prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Compound Finance is built on the Ethereum blockchain and provides lending and borrowing services for various cryptocurrencies.

The governance mechanism allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process regarding the protocol's development, changes, and upgrades. The native token of Compound, COMP, plays a central role in this governance system.

#### Key aspects of Compound Governance include:

1. COMP Token: COMP is the governance token of the Compound protocol. Holders of COMP can propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol. The number of COMP tokens held by an individual determines their voting power.

2. Proposal Creation: Any COMP holder can create a proposal to suggest changes to the protocol. Proposals can range from protocol parameter adjustments to adding new features.

3. Voting: COMP holders can vote "for," "against," or "abstain" on proposed changes. The voting power is directly proportional to the number of COMP tokens held by the voter.

4. Quorum and Approval: Proposals must meet a minimum quorum (a minimum number of votes) to be considered valid. Additionally, they require a certain percentage of "for" votes to be approved.

5. Execution of Proposals: Once a proposal is approved, it can be executed, resulting in the implementation of the proposed changes.

Compound Governance empowers the community to collectively govern the protocol, ensuring a decentralized and inclusive decision-making process for the platform's evolution and improvements.

### <h3 id="Gbd">1.6 GovernorBravoDelegate<h3>

The GovernorBravoDelegate contract is an implementation of the GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2 and GovernorBravoEvents contracts, which are part of the governance system of the Compound protocol. The purpose of this contract is to allow token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, such as adding new assets to the protocol or changing the interest rates of existing assets. The contract defines various constants and functions that set the parameters for the governance process, such as the minimum and maximum voting periods, the quorum votes required for a proposal to succeed, and the maximum number of actions that can be included in a proposal. Overall, the GovernorBravoDelegate contract plays a critical role in the decentralized governance of the Compound protocol.

## <h2 id="review"> 2.0 CONTRACT REVIEW <h2>

The contract contains the following state constant variables:

```bash
    string public constant name = "Compound Governor Bravo";
```

This line defines a public constant string variable named name and assigns it the value "Compound Governor Bravo". This variable is used to store the name of the Governor Bravo contract.

```bash
    uint public constant MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 50000e18; // 50,000 Comp
```

This line defines a public constant unsigned integer variable named MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD and assigns it the value 50000e18. This variable is used to store the minimum amount of COMP tokens that a proposer must hold in order to create a proposal.

```bash
    uint public constant MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 100000e18; //100,000 Comp
```

This line defines a public constant unsigned integer variable named MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD and assigns it the value 50000e18. This variable is used to store the minimum amount of COMP tokens that a proposer must hold in order to create a proposal.

```bash
    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_PERIOD = 5760; // About 24 hours
```

This line defines a public constant variable called MIN_VOTING_PERIOD with a value of 5760. This value represents the minimum voting period that can be set in the governance system of the Compound protocol.

```bash
    uint public constant MAX_VOTING_PERIOD = 80640; // About 2 weeks
```

This line defines a public constant variable called MAX_VOTING_PERIOD with a value of 80640. This value represents the maximum voting period that can be set in the governance system of the Compound protocol.

```bash
    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_DELAY = 1;
```

This line defines a public constant variable called MIN_VOTING_DELAY with a value of 1. This value represents the minimum voting delay that can be set in the governance system of the Compound protocol.

```

This line defines a public constant variable called DOMAIN_TYPEHASH with a value generated by hashing the string "EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)" using the keccak256 hash function. This value represents the type hash of the contract's domain for use in EIP-712 signatures.

```bash
    bytes32 public constant BALLOT_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Ballot(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support)");
```

This line defines a public constant variable called BALLOT_TYPEHASH with a value generated by hashing the string "Ballot(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support)" using the keccak256 hash function. This value represents the type hash of the ballot struct used by the contract for use in EIP-712 signatures.

The following functions are part of the compound governance contract and are all carefully and thoroghly intertwined for optimum performance.

### 2.1 initialize():

This function initializes the contract. It is a public function with five input parameters: timelock*, comp address*, votingPeriod*, votingDelay*, and proposalThreshold*. This function is used to initialize the contract during the delegator constructor. It includes checks to ensure the timelock address is not already set, the caller of the function is the admin address, the timelock* and comp* address are not the null address, the votingPeriod*, votingDelay* and proposalThreshold* parameters are within the valid range of values defined by their min and max constants. It then sets the timelock, comp, votingPeriod, votingDelay, and proposalThreshold variables to the values passed in as arguments to the function

### 2.2 propose():

This function creates a new proposal. It is a public function with three input parameters: targets (an array of target addresses), values (an array of Eth values), signatures (an array of function signatures), calldatas (array) and description of the proposal This function is used to create a new proposal. It includes checks to ensure the Governor Bravo contract is active, the proposer has enough voting power to create a proposal except if whitelisted, the length of the targets, values, signatures, and calldatas arrays are equal. It also ensures the length of the targets array is not empty and not greater than the maximum number of operations allowed in a proposal. After it calculates the start and end blocks of the voting period for the new proposal, based on the current block number, the voting delay, and the voting period, the function then checks whether the proposer has an active or pending proposal, creates a new proposal and set the state variable proposalCount to the proposalCount + 1. Then an event is emitted to signal the creation of the new proposal.

#### 2.3 queue():

This function is used to add a proposal to the queue in the Timelock contract. The function takes a single argument, proposalId, which is the ID of the proposal to be queued. The function checks that the proposal with the specified proposalId is in the Succeeded state, retrieves the proposal from the proposals mapping, calculates the earliest time at which the proposal can be executed, and loops through the targets, values, signatures, and calldatas arrays of the proposal to add each action to the queue in the Timelock contract. Finally, the eta value is stored in the eta field of the proposal, and a ProposalQueued event is emitted with the proposalId and eta values as arguments.
